  --> Hive is a high level language used to run queries on data stored in hadoop
  --> Hive is a dataware house infrastructure tool to process structured data in hadoop
  --> It recides on top of hadoop to summerize big data, andmakes quering and analysing easy
  --> Initially hive was developed by facebook, later the apache software foundation took it up and developed it further as an open source under the name apache hive

Features of Hive
  --> It stores schema in a database and processed data into HDFS
  --> It is designed for online analytical processing
  --> It provides SQL type language for querying called hiveQl or HQL [High Query Language]
  --> It is familiar, fast, scalable and extensable

# Hive Architecture & Installation
  --> Hive is a high level language used to run queries on data stored in hadoop
  --> Hive is a dataware house infrastructure tool to process structured data in a hadoop
  Hive Architecture
    --> In hive architecture we have different components or units
   1. User interface
     --> Hive is a dataware house infrastructure software that can create interaction between user and hdfs
     --> The user interface that hive supports are hive webUI, hive command line and Hive HD insight [Provides several cluster types, which are tuned for specific work loads]
   2. Meta store
     --> Hive chooses respective database servers to store the schema or meta data of tables, databases, columns in table, their datatypes and hdfs mapping
  Hive Installation
    --> Before hive installation we have to check whether the java and the hadoop also installed on our system or not
   Step 1:- Download hive tar
     Command:- wget     https://hive.apache.org/general/downloads/ or https://hive.com/download-hive/ 
   Step 2:- Extract the tar file
     Command:- tar-XZF apache_hive_2.1

# HQL
  --> Hive aims to solve the problem by offeringf an SQL like interface called Hive QL on top of hadoop
  --> Hive achieves this task by converting queries written in hiveQL into map reduce task that are then run across the hadoop cluster to fetch the desired result
  --> The hiveQL is a query language for hive to process and analyse structured data in a meta store 
  --> Hive supports SQL features like create, drop, select from where clauses, jointers and so on
 Hive DDL commands
   --> DDL statements are used to build and modify the tables and other objects
   1. Create database statements
