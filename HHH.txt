  --> Hive is a high level language used to run queries on data stored in hadoop
  --> Hive is a dataware house infrastructure tool to process structured data in hadoop
  --> It recides on top of hadoop to summerize big data, andmakes quering and analysing easy
  --> Initially hive was developed by facebook, later the apache software foundation took it up and developed it further as an open source under the name apache hive

Features of Hive
  --> It stores schema in a database and processed data into HDFS
  --> It is designed for online analytical processing
  --> It provides SQL type language for querying called hiveQl or HQL [High Query Language]
  --> It is familiar, fast, scalable and extensable

# Hive Architecture & Installation
  --> Hive is a high level language used to run queries on data stored in hadoop
  --> Hive is a dataware house infrastructure tool to process structured data in a hadoop
  Hive Architecture
    --> In hive architecture we have different components or units
   1. User interface
     --> Hive is a dataware house infrastructure software that can create interaction between user and hdfs
     --> The user interface that hive supports are hive webUI, hive command line and Hive HD insight [Provides several cluster types, which are tuned for specific work loads]
   2. Meta store
     --> Hive chooses respective database servers to store the schema or meta data of tables, databases, columns in table, their datatypes and hdfs mapping
  Hive Installation
    --> Before hive installation we have to check whether the java and the hadoop also installed on our system or not
   Step 1:- Download hive tar
     Command:- wget     https://hive.apache.org/general/downloads/ or https://hive.com/download-hive/ 
   Step 2:- Extract the tar file
     Command:- tar-XZF apache_hive_2.1

# Comparison of Hive and RDBMS [Traditional DBMS]
  Hive
   1. It is used to maintain dataware house
   2. It uses HQL [Hive Query Language]
   3. Hive is based on the notation of write ones read many times
   4. Hive doesnot support OLTP [Online transaction processing] but it support OLAP [Online Analytical Processing]
   5. Record level updates is not possible in hive
   6. Hive data size is peta bytes
   7. Distributed processing done via map/reduce
   8. Normalized and denormalized both types of data is stored
   9. Sharing method is used for partitionar 
   10. It supports automation partition 
   11. Table in hive are dense [large amount]
   12. Hive enforces schema on read i.e., schema does not verify loading data
   13. Hive is very easily scalable at low cost 
   14. Hivr is shooted for static data analysis [non real time data] Ex:- Text file

  RDBMS
   1. It is used to maintain database
   2. It uses SQL [Structured Query Language]
   3. RDBMS is designed for read and write many times
   4. RDBMS supports only OLTP
   5. Record level updates, insertions, delete and transactions are possible
   6. In RDBMS maximum data size is tera bytes
   7. Distributed processing varies by vendor [company or person]
   8. Normalized data is stored
   9. No partitioned method is used
   10. It doesnot support partition
   11. Tables in RDBMS are sparse [small amount]
   12. It enforces schema on write i.e,. schema verify loading data, else rejected
   13. It is not scalable to low cost, been use it provides solution to the customer
   14. RDBMS is best suited for dynamic data analysis [real time data] EX:- data from the sensors and web features

# HQL
  --> Hive aims to solve the problem by offeringf an SQL like interface called Hive QL on top of hadoop
  --> Hive achieves this task by converting queries written in hiveQL into map reduce task that are then run across the hadoop cluster to fetch the desired result
  --> The hiveQL is a query language for hive to process and analyse structured data in a meta store 
  --> Hive supports SQL features like create, drop, select from where clauses, jointers and so on
 Hive DDL commands
   --> DDL statements are used to build and modify the tables and other objects
   1. Create database statements
