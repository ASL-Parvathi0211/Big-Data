# Four V's in BigData or Characteristics of BigData
Four V's are the characteristics that differentiate BigData and Data
  1. Volume
    --> a particular data can actually be considered as a Big Data or not depend upon volume of data
        Ex:- A text file is a few "KB", a sound file is a few "MB", full length movie is a few "GB"
    --> Hence volume is a characteristic which needs to be considered while dealing with Big Data 

  2. velocity
    --> A data is called a Big Data when the speed of generation of data is fast
    --> Velocity measures how fast data is produced and modified
       Ex:- Youtube videos [Uploading & downloadings]
    --> Hence velocity is another characteristic which needs to be considered while depending with BigData
    
  3. variety
    --> A data is called a BigData when it is collected from heterogeneous sources and the nature of data can be both structured and unstructured
    --> In earlier days data is in the form of spread sheets and data bases
    --> But now a days data is in the form of Emails, Photos, Videos and Pdf's etc,.
    --> Hence variety is an another characteristic which needsto be considered while dealing with BigData

  4. Variability
    --> this differs to the inconsistency of data i.e., data should not be biased[format]
    --> This is where we need need to be able to identify the relevance of data and ensure data clensie is done to only store valuable data
