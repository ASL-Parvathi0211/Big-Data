    In 1960's automatic data compression was published it explores information in hte past few years makes it necessary to storing the information to be minimised
    In 1970's the information flow is ordered to track the volume of information to calculating the country
    In 1980's research projects was started to measuring a volume of information in bits
    In 1990's digital storage systems become more economical than paper storage
    In 2000's onwards various method was intoduced some information technique where contolling the storage volume, velocity and variety of data in merge
