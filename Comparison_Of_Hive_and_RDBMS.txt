# Comparison of Hive and RDBMS [Traditional DBMS]
  Hive
   1. It is used to maintain dataware house
   2. It uses HQL [Hive Query Language]
   3. Hive is based on the notation of write ones read many times
   4. Hive doesnot support OLTP [Online transaction processing] but it support OLAP [Online Analytical Processing]
   5. Record level updates is not possible in hive
   6. Hive data size is peta bytes
   7. Distributed processing done via map/reduce
   8. Normalized and denormalized both types of data is stored
   9. Sharing method is used for partitionar 
   10. It supports automation partition 
   11. Table in hive are dense [large amount]
   12. Hive enforces schema on read i.e., schema does not verify loading data
   13. Hive is very easily scalable at low cost 
   14. Hivr is shooted for static data analysis [non real time data] Ex:- Text file

  RDBMS
   1. It is used to maintain database
   2. It uses SQL [Structured Query Language]
   3. RDBMS is designed for read and write many times
   4. RDBMS supports only OLTP
   5. Record level updates, insertions, delete and transactions are possible
   6. In RDBMS maximum data size is tera bytes
   7. Distributed processing varies by vendor [company or person]
   8. Normalized data is stored
   9. No partitioned method is used
   10. It doesnot support partition
   11. Tables in RDBMS are sparse [small amount]
   12. It enforces schema on write i.e,. schema verify loading data, else rejected
   13. It is not scalable to low cost, been use it provides solution to the customer
   14. RDBMS is best suited for dynamic data analysis [real time data] EX:- data from the sensors and web features
