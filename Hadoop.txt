# Hadoop
  --> Hadoop is a frame work that allows you to first store big data in a distributed environment so that you can process it parallely
  --> There are basically two components in Hadoop

  --> The first one in HDFS (Hadoop distributed file system) for storage, that allows you to store data of various formats across a cluster
  --> The second one is YARN for resource management in Hadoop
  --> It allows parallel processing over the data i.e., stored across HDFS
    a. HDFS Architecture
      --> In HDFS name node is the master node and data nodes are the slaves
      --> HDFS is the primary storage unit in the Hadoop
      --> The HDFS is the reason behind the quick data accessing and scalability of Hadoop
      --> The HDFS compresses the following components
        1. name node
          --> It is the master node that maintains and manages the datanode
          --> It records the meta data of all the blocks stored in the cluster 
           EX:- Location of bloack stored, size of the files, permission etc,.
          --> It records each and every change that take place to the file system meta data
          --> If a file is deleted in HDFS the name node will immediately record this in the edit log
          --> It regularly receives a heartbeat and a block report from all the data nodes are live 
          --> It keeps a record of all the blocks in the HDFS and data nodes in which they are stored
        2. Data node 
          --> It is the slave node which run on each slave machine
          --> The actual data is stored in database
          --> It is responsible for serving read/write request from the clients
          --> It is also responsible for creating blocks, deleting blocks and replicating the same based on the decisions taken by the name node 
        3. Secondary name node
          --> As the name speak the secondary name node is not a backup of the name node
          --> It acts as a buffer to the name node
          --> It stores the intermediate updates of the name node and updates the information when the name node is inactive
    b. YARN [Yet another resource negotiator]
      --> It provides the resource management
      --> YARN is called as the operating system of Hadoop
      --> As it is responsible for managing and monitoring work loads
      --> An YARN compress of the following components:
        1. Resource Manager
          --> It is the core component of yarn and it is considered as the "Master"
          --> It is responsible for providing generic and flexible frame works to administrate the computing resource in a hadoop cluster
          --> Resource manager receives the processing request and passes the parts of request to corresponding node managers
          --> It keeps a track of the heart beats from the node manager
        2. Node Manager
          --> It is the slave and it serves the resource manager
          --> Node manager is assigned to all the nodes in a cluster
          --> The main responsibility of the node manager is to monitor the status of the container and app managers
          --> Node managers installed on every data nodes
          --> It is responsible for execution of task on every single data node
