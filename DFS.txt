# Distributed File System
    A file system is a part of operating system which stores and organise data on a secondary storage device in an effective way for fast retrival of data
    It specifies how files are to be named and where they are placed logicaly for storage and retreval
    The type of file system depends on the OS used by the computer system
    # Major file systems include the folowing
      1. FAT [File allocation Table]

# Distributed File System
  A DFS is a file system which stores data on a server
  The Data is accessed and processed as if it was stored on the local claint machine
  The DFS makes it convinient to share information and files amoung users on a network in a controlled and authorised way
  The server allows the client users to share files and store data just like they are storing the information locally
  When a user access a file on the server the server sends the user a copy of file which is catched on the users computer
  DFS is used to make files distributed across multiple servers but appear to users as if they reside in one place on the network

  # Benefits of DFS
    The advantage of using distibuted file system are
    1. Better resource management: That is users access all resource through a local system
    2. Easy accessability: Users can easily access folder at remote place without knowing the physical location of the folder
    3. Fault tolerance: That is stored data is replicated to avoid loss of data due to failure of one server
    4. Better workload management: DFS allows administraters to distribute shared folders and work loads several servers for more efficent network and server resource usage and many others
